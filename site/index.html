        <h1 id="a9">Understanding the Basics of HTML <br> Websites</h1>
        <p id="a10">HTML, which stands for <a href="">Hypertext Markup Language,</a> is the primary language of <br> the
            World Wide Web. An HTML document
            sets the content and structure of a web <br> page. When you view a page in your browser, what you’re looking
            at
            is
            your <br> browser’s interpretation of an HTML file that was retrieved from a web server. <br><br>
            HTML is almost always used in conjunction with two other front-end languages: <br> CSS and JavaScript. <a
                href=""> CSS (Cascading
                Style Sheets) is</a> a language that controls <br> the styling of a web page, including colors, fonts,
            and
            layouts.
            <a href="">JavaScript</a> is a <br> programming language that enables more complex client-side features like
            <br> interactive elements
            and animations. <br><br>

            The most recent numbered release of HTML is HTML5. Released in 2008, <a href="">HTML5 <br> notably
                contained</a>
            several
            improvements to handle multimedia content like audio <br> and video and <a href="">semantically rich
                elements</a> to describe page
            structure. <br><br>
            Going forward, there will be no more numbered version numbers for HTML. That <br> means there will be no
            HTML6,
            and
            HTML5 is now called “HTML.” However, a <br> number of improvements and enhancements have been released since
            HTML5 <br>
            came out in 2008. <br><br>

            If you want to know more about HTML and how to write it, I recommend starting <br> with our <a
                href="">ultimate
                guide to HTML.</a>
            You’ll learn everything you need to know to <br> understand this post in its entirety. <br> <br>

            Because every website is written in HTML, regardless of the complexity of the site <br> or the number of
            technologies
            involved, it’s a good idea to immerse yourself in it. <br> And yes, this is true even if the website uses
            server-side
            languages like PHP (such <br> as <a href="">WordPress</a>). With a tool like WordPress, the web server will
            process the PHP <br> and
            query the site's database to <a href="">generate the finished HTML document</a> to <br> deliver to visitors'
            browsers. <br> <br>

            You can take any page and lift up the hood to see the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <br> code that bring it to
            life.
            <br> <br>

            Later in this post, I’ll review some of the ways <a href="">designers and developers</a> harness <br> HTML
            in
            their creative works. <br> <br>

        <p id="gh">To get comfortable with HTML (along with CSS and JavaScript), I think it’s a good <br> idea for you
            to
            create a
            website or two from scratch. <br> <br>

            Even building a relatively simple HTML website can help you learn how HTML <br> works and provide you with a
            solid
            foundation before you move on to more <br> advanced projects. <br> <br>
            Here are some ideas for <a href="">beginner-friendly simple HTML projects</a> you can create:
        <ul id="as">
            <li> <b>A personal website.</b> Create a <a href="">personal site</a> that shows off <a href="">your
                    resume,</a>
                work <br> experience, interests, skills,
                and personality. You can return to this project and <br> revise over time as your skills develop. </li>
            <li> <b>An informational site.</b> Pick a topic you’re interested in, then code up a simple <br> website
                that
                teaches
                visitors about it. You can play around with various <br> technologies to enhance your storytelling —
                we'll
                share
                some examples below.</li>
            <li> <b>A small business website or a non-profit website.</b> You can volunteer to create <br> a <a
                    href="">website for a small local business</a>
                in your area. Or, you can help a non-profit <br> and give it an online presence.</li>
            <li> <b>A blog.</b> While there are many great <a href="">blogging platforms</a> out there, consider <br>
                making
                your own. A simple HTML
                website can work great for basic blogs.</li>
            <li> <b>A portfolio.</b> Want to <a href="">show off your other creative works</a> ?Try building a <br>
                portfolio, be it a <a href="">photo gallery</a> , a
                video showcase, or a <a href="">collection of your <br> writing.</a> The best part? We even have a <a
                    href="">step-by-step guide for
                    beginners on <br> how to create a portfolio site with HTML.</a> </li>
            </p>
        </ul>
        <p id="ua">To get started creating your first HTML site, I recommend following this <br> excellent tutorial from
            freeCodeCamp. <br>
            As you grow more comfortable with HTML basics, you can begin to branch <br> out into bolder, more unique
            design
            choices. But still, even elaborate websites <br> can often be boiled down to a handful of HTML features
            working
            together to <br>make a cohesive experience. <br>

            Next, I’ll walk you through examples of HTML websites that use elements <br> creatively. I’ll also help
            unpack what
            makes them tick.

        <p id="fr"><b>What I like:</b> Gloutir is a design and development studio based out of Houston, <br> Texas, that
            features a vibrant,
            immaculately crafted website. While the hero <br> section isn‘t anything too crazy, you’ll experience tons
            of
            interesting effects <br> as you scroll down the page. <br><br>

            At first glance, this site may look technically complex. However, you can achieve <br> most of the effects
            with
            plain HTML and CSS. While there’s an occasional <br> JavaScript-powered effect (for instance, animated text
            and a
            card slider), a lot of <br> this site’s appeal comes down to smart choices of colors, fonts, and images.
            <br><br>

            It’s worth digging into the page's source code if you’re curious. For example, when <br> I checked out the
            code,
            I could see that Gloutir used Webflow to build its site and <br> some of the different HTML techniques that
            the
            site relies on. <br>
            Check out our <a href="">guide to the “inspect element” tool</a> to learn how you can do the same. <br>

            If you want to inspect the code of a website, my experience is that <a href="">Chrome offers the <br> best
                developer tools</a>
            (like “inspect element”). However, most other browsers also offer <br> developer tools. <br><br>
            <b>Pro Tip:</b> Need help choosing a color scheme for your site? Here are a few I love.
        </p>

        <p id="b1">
            <b> 2.<a href="">Joshua's World</a></b>
        </p>

        <img src="image8.jpg" alt="" id="pr">
        <p id="b2"><b>What I like:</b> Joshua is an interactive designer who uses his own interactive <br> Joshua‘s
            World website to connect
            with potential clients. Visitors start on a simple <br> welcome screen but can then enter the much more
            engaging
            Joshua’s World interface. <br><br>

            Visitors can then “ride” around the world on a bicycle while checking out Joshua‘s <br> various projects and
            learning
            more about his experience. I think it’s much more engaging <br> than a traditional portfolio that lists
            projects as
            thumbnails. And, given that Joshua is <br> an interaction designer, I love how the design really shows off
            what <br> he
            can do. <br><br>

            While most of the basic content on Joshua‘s website is powered by pure HTML, <br> the interactive elements
            rely on
            JavaScript. Joshua also uses the Sanity content <br> management system to help him manage his site’s
            content. <br><br>

            Overall, I think that this is a great example of how you can use your website's <br> concept to reinforce
            what your
            website is trying to achieve. Rather than just telling <br> people about his skills as an interactive
            designer,
            Joshua shows people <br> his skills. <br><br>

            <b>Pro Tip:</b> Consider working with a <a href="">web designer</a> to create bespoke designs for <br> your
            HTML
            site. <br><br>
        </p>
        <p id="b1">
            <b>3. <a href="">Ruby on Rails</a></b>
        </p>
        <img src="image11.jpg" alt="" id="pr">
        <p id="b4">
            <b>What I like:</b> Ruby on Rails is a popular open-source <a href="">development framework</a> <br>
            developers can use to build
            server-side web applications. The Ruby on Rails <br> website does a great job of communicating that with a
            clean,
            modern design. <br><br>

            I especially like how the website is able to keep things interesting with its color <br> and typography
            choices,
            rather than relying on more complex animations. The red <br> headings give a pop of color, while the actual
            design is simple. <br><br>

            The entire site is pretty much just pure HTML with CSS styling. None of the effects <br> that you see
            require
            JavaScript. For example, the Ruby on Rails site creates <br> interesting hover effects using basic CSS.
            <br><br>

            I think that it‘s a great reminder that you don’t need fancy CSS and JavaScript <br> effects to build a
            great
            HTML website. Those elements can help in certain <br> situations, especially with engagement and
            storytelling (as
            many of my other <br> examples show). However, they are not a requirement to build an engaging <br> website.
            <br><br>

            <b>Pro Tip:</b> Make your website more engaging with thoughtful <a href="">CSS animations.</a> Here <br> are
            some I love. (Don’t worry
            — it’s not too tricky to learn!) <br><br>

        <img src="image13.jpg" alt="" id="pr">
        <p id="b4">
            <b>What I like:</b> Project Lima is an inclusive design initiative that launched its <br> Understanding
            Neurodiversity
            project to educate the public about neurodivergent <br> individuals, how they operate in society, and some
            common
            myths associated <br> with these individuals. <br><br>

            I recommend giving this experience a full watch if you have the time. It’s a <br> touching blend of
            illustration,
            <a href="">visual texture,</a> music, sound effects, and <br> <a href="">meaningful storytelling</a> to
            provide a better understanding of
            neurodiverse <br> people. <br><br>

            In particular, the website’s use of <a href="">scalable vector graphic (SVG)</a> artwork is <br> stunning
            and adds a visual
            framework for communicating the site’s information. <br> Each screen transitions smoothly to the next with
            animated graphics. As far as <br> online storytelling goes, I think this is as good as it gets. <br><br>

            <b>Pro Tip:</b> Don’t forget that copy plays into the experience your users have on your <br> site. This is

            Understanding Neurodiversity does exceptionally well. <br><br>

            becoming the standard for playing video on web <br> pages. <br><br>

            Today, many websites employ this element for auto-playing videos, fullscreen <br> videos, and <a

            If you want to achieve a similar effect on your site, the HTML5 video element is <br> the best way. I think
            that
            it’s a much cleaner alternative to, say, an embedded <br> <a href="">iframe</a> from YouTube on your page.
            <br><br>

            <b>Pro Tip:</b> For <a href="">accessibility reasons,</a> it’s a good idea to let users pause videos and
            <br> also to let them choose
            whether or not the video plays sound.

        <p id="b4">
            <b>What I like:</b> Caffeine Post is a post-production video studio that, as you might <br> guess, also
            makes great use
            of the HTML video element. I love how the homepage <br> immediately confronts you with a chaotic but
            immersive
            video montage of the <br> company’s work and dares you to watch more. <br><br>

            The selected works page is a series of thumbnails, each itself a video element. You <br> can hover your
            cursor
            over a thumbnail to watch it play in a loop and click on it to <br> watch a longer video preview with sound.
            Plus, you can filter the works by <br> category (commercial, film, etc.). <br><br>

            For such an impressive website, it might seem surprising that you can build many <br> of its key features
            with
            just pure HTML. I think it just shows how far even simple <br> web technologies have come over the past
            decade. <br><br>

            <b> Pro Tip:</b> Don’t neglect the power that video can have in immersing your users in <br> the world of
            your site. The
            best part is adding video to an HTML page example is <br> easy. <br><br>

        <p id="b4">
            <b>What I like:</b> <a href="">Microsites</a> allow brands to experiment with new web design <br> techniques
            while promoting a product.
            Mailchimp’s Dumpling Delivery website is a <br> prime example of this: Visitors can play nine holes of
            virtual
            miniature golf in an <br> attempt to deliver dumplings to hungry customers. <br><br>

            Just about the entire experience is built around HTML canvas, with some <br> JavaScript magic happening in
            the
            background to make the game dynamics <br> possible. Dumpling Delivery showcases the limits of what you can
            accomplish with <br> HTML and JavaScript with some expert help. <br><br>

            The only thing that I don't like is that the website can <a href="">take a little longer to load</a> <br> on
            slower connections.
            However, this is expected, given how much interactivity is <br> going on with the site. <br><br>

            <b>Pro Tip:</b> Love this site? I do, too. For more inspiration, take a look at <a href="">some of our <br>
                favorite interactive
                websites.</a> <br><br>

            <b>8. <a href=""> Make Your Move (Adidas)</a></b>

        <img src="img10.jpg" alt="" id="pr">
        <p id="b4">
            <b>What I like:</b> Adidas made this microsite to promote the company’s global World <br> of Sports
            headquarters in
            Herzogenaurach, Germany. I like how it leverages video <br> and crisp images to help you experience the
            space
            from every angle. <br><br>

            The website does a good job of putting visitors on a pretty defined path for the <br> whole experience,
            starting
            with a video (displayed with the HTML5 video element) <br> and following up with an image slideshow to
            highlight
            the best parts of working <br> for the company. <br><br>

            I also like that there's no scrolling down — everything happens with side-to-side <br> movement, which I
            noticed
            creates a linear feel to the storytelling experience. <br><br>

            <b> Pro Tip: </b> Sometimes, a larger site doesn’t necessarily mean a better one. This is a <br> great
            example of using an
            HTML microsite can help tell a structured, digestible <br> story about your brand. <br><br>

           <b> What I like:</b> Some websites use video to show, while others, like this example, use <br> it to immerse. Created by
            Danish videographer Nikolaj Juhlsen, the Take a Ride With Me website experience drops you on the seat of a
            mountain bike as you’re taken down treacherous trails across Europe. <br><br>

            This site is about as close as you can get to a real mountain biking experience through your desktop, and
            it’s accomplished with HTML video alone. If the quality of your content is high enough, you don’t need wild
            effects to pull off a great site. <br><br>

            That said, the homepage of this site does layer on some interesting cursor effects and scrolling effects for
            some added flair. For example, when you first land on the site, the “Play” button follows your mouse cursor
            around, which I think creates an interesting engagement effect (and also makes it easy for visitors to start
            the experience). <br><br>

            <b>Pro Tip:</b> Experiment with different cursor effects to determine if adding one is intuitive for your site or
            if you’d be better off leaving it alone. <br><br>
